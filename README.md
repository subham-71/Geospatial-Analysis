# COVID-19 Cases Analysis
Here I have analyzed the live COVID-19 cases from 195 countries in the world and have  presented them in the form of choropleth maps, marker maps, heat maps and scatter plot so as to get a good visualisation of the trend of the panddemic.
The live dataset used here is "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv"

To get the visualisations : Download the ipynb files and run on google colab or Jupyter Notebook
